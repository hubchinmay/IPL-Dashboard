### 5. Highlights

#### ‚Ä¢ Business Problem

With IPL being one of the most followed cricket leagues globally, there‚Äôs a need to convert raw match statistics into visual insights. Teams, fans, and analysts often struggle to understand performance trends, player impact, and win margins quickly using spreadsheets alone.

Key questions such as:
‚Äì Which team has the highest win count?
‚Äì Who are the most impactful players?
‚Äì What are the average win margins across seasons?
‚Äì Is there any correlation between strike rate and economy rate?
‚Ä¶ are difficult to answer at a glance.


#### ‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To create an intuitive and visually engaging Power BI dashboard that:
‚Äì Analyzes team and player performance using match data
‚Äì Highlights key performance indicators like strike rate and economy rate
‚Äì Provides interactive filters to explore trends by team, date, and win type
‚Äì Supports better understanding of IPL dynamics through visual storytelling
